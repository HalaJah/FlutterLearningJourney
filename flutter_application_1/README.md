Learning Flutter Basics: 

This is the initial user interface (UI) design of an app developed for the purpose of learning the fundamental concepts of Flutter widgets and their layout. The UI showcases a variety of widgets including but not limited to columns, rows, expanded widgets, icons, app bars, and more. It serves as an educational starting point for my understanding of the basics of Flutter app development.
